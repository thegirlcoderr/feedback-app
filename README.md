### What I Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in the following areas:

- I gained familiarity with React. Also learned about components, JSX (JavaScript XML), and how to create functional components
- I learned how to manage state using the useState hook. I used state variables to store and update data.
- I learned how to use the useEffect hook to perform side effects, such as fetching data from an API.
- I learned how to implement the Context API to manage global state across components. This includes creating a context, provider, and consumer. I also learned to utilize context to share data and functions across components without needing to pass props through multiple levels.
